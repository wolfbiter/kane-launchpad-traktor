#Kane Launchpad Traktor Preset
Version 1.0.x


------------------------
###Featuring a [Live Demo/Tutorial](https://youtu.be/dpdWzb0PEWo)!
------------------------
+ This repository contains all the components necessary to link a Launchpad to Traktor with
my customized set of controls and LEDs.
+ Here are several quick-reference guides for the [The Controls](#ii-controls-list).
+ This script is driven by 2 core principles:
  - Controls' effects and layout should reflect actual DJ needs.
  - Proper abstractions create intuitive and powerful controls, freeing the mind and body of the DJ for more complex expression.
+ For any questions, suggestions, or bug reports, I encourage you to either [Submit An Issue](https://github.com/wolfbiter/kane-launchpad-traktor/issues?state=open) or [Contact Me](#contact-me)!

####NOTE: The guide assumes the user has at least Traktor v2.0 installed.
